## Versioning
The version consists of a major, a minor and a revision field. (major.minor.revision)
If the major version changes, then these changes are incompatible with prior versions. Changes to the minor version indicate backwards compatibility. The revision field is reserved for the Pandoras Box revision that is required to use all features. It might be possible to use the SDK with an older revision of Pandoras Box, but not all the commands will work.
